# CV Interview Cheatsheet

## ADHD prep tips

- **Don't memorize — reload.** Read this 30 min before the interview. That's it. Your working memory will carry it.
- **Fill this in once, poorly.** Bullet fragments and half-sentences are fine. You're not writing an essay — you're leaving breadcrumbs for future-you.
- **Problem → Did → Result.** If you blank mid-answer, say "the problem was..." and the rest will follow. This structure is your safety net.
- **It's okay to say "I don't recall the exact number."** Follow with what you *do* remember: the approach, the tool, the before/after feel. Interviewers care more about your thinking than precise metrics.
- **Time-box prep to 20 minutes.** Set a timer. Skim each section, mouth a one-sentence answer. Done. Perfectionism is the enemy here.

Review this before each interview. For each bullet, recall: **what was the problem → what you did → what happened**.
