# CV Todos

## High impact

- [ ] **NOLD first bullet — make specific.** "Implemented the majority of frontend flows" is vague. Replace with the hardest or most impactful flow you built (search, product listing, seller onboarding, etc.)
- [ ] **WOOM description — tighten.** "Senior frontend engineer" repeats the role title, and "Worked across..." reads like a list. Proposed: "Led frontend on a fertility tracking hybrid app with 2M users and 200k+ community threads. Owned dev-design collaboration, improving the design system and raising UX standards across the app."
- [ ] **Scalefocus — add substance.** Two thin bullets with no impact. Add anything concrete: team size, user count, compliance standard (HIPAA?), timeline beaten. Healthcare + compliance is a strong signal.

## Medium impact

- [ ] **Summary mentions "search systems"** but no experience bullet backs it up. Either drop it or add a bullet somewhere.
- [ ] **Clipsbee has no traction metric.** StringPal now has "150 WAU" which makes Clipsbee look weaker. Add users, videos generated, revenue, or "launched to paying customers."
- [ ] **"Strong product sense" in summary is vague.** Replace with concrete proof: "Strong product instincts — redesigned checkout flows, took ownership of UI/UX, and drove design system improvements."

## Polish

- [ ] **WOOM guidelines bullet is a laundry list.** "Established frontend guidelines, REST API design standards, Sentry integration, and E2E testing" — pick 1-2 or frame as impact: "Established frontend standards and E2E testing practices adopted across the engineering team."
- [ ] **Teaching Assistant — add period.** Currently floating with no dates. Add the year range.
